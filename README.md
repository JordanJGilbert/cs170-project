# Fall 2022 CS170 Project

This repo contains our team's ([discordggTYsy64VcWT](https://discord.gg/TYsy64VcWT)) solution to the Fall 2022 CS170 Project. The project is an NP-Hard optimization problem that involves finding an optimal partition of a graph based on an objective function seeking to minimize the number of groups, equalize the distribution of nodes across groups, and minimize the sum of intra-group edge weights. The project is described in more detail [here](https://cs170.org/assets/pdf/project.pdf).

We primarily used a simulated annealing approach framed inside a genetic algorithm heuristic to compute our results. The relevant code is in `main.cpp` and `header.cpp`. In addition, to focus our compute power on the most pressing inputs where we were lowest ranked on, we run a BeautifulSoup script in `python/scraper.ipynb` that writes relevant information about each input into `queue.txt`, sorted so the lowest ranking inputs with the largest delta score appear first. Our other minor algorithms and attempts can be found in `extras.cpp`, `python/jax_pop_sim.py`, `python/knapsack.py`, and `python/main.ipynb`. Our complete set of inputs and outputs can be found in `tests/`, which is intuitively organized. Our inputs for phase 1 can be found in `/phase_1`. Our final submission file for phase 2 is `submission.tar`, which contains our best results for each input which were compiled to `/phase_2`.

To see our algorithm in action, you can run `python/scraper.ipynb` to populate `queue.txt`. Then run `main.cpp` and optimal results will be written to the respective folder in `tests/` (the file name is the score rounded to the nearest integer as well as a tag used for identification purposes). To see all the best solutions in one place, run `submit.py` to copy all results to `/phase_2` and tar them into `submission.tar`.
